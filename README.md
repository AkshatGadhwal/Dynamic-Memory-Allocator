# Dynamic Memory Allocator

Dynamic Memory Allocator is a Java project developed for the COL106 course. It simulates memory allocation in an operating system, implementing time-efficient and cost-efficient methods.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a dynamic memory allocation system that efficiently manages memory resources in an operating system. It focuses on optimizing both time and cost factors associated with memory allocation.

## Features

- **Memory Allocation**: Simulate the allocation of memory blocks to processes based on various allocation techniques.
- **Allocation Methods**: Implement time-efficient and cost-efficient methods for memory allocation, such as First-Fit, Best-Fit, Next-Fit, Worst-Fit, and Buddy System.
- **Process Management**: Manage processes and their memory requirements within the simulated memory allocator.
- **Memory Deallocation**: Handle the release of memory blocks when processes terminate or free allocated memory.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, arrays, and other suitable data structures for memory management
- **Allocation Techniques**: First-Fit, Best-Fit, Next-Fit, Worst-Fit, and Buddy System
- **Algorithm Design**: Design efficient algorithms for memory allocation and deallocation
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Analyze the time and space complexity of the implemented algorithms
